The thesis track offers a research-intensive experience for students \nseeking additional advanced degrees or research-based employment. The track culminates in a \nthesis project. The thesis track affords the experience of writing for publication and is suited for \nstudents with a project requiring more time to pursue. The capstone track is experiential in nature \nand is the appropriate choice for non-academic professionals or students seeking a more structured, \ntime-confined project. The track culminates in a capstone project that covers a variety of options \nsuch as case studies, internships, surveys, or extensive literature reviews. The M.S. track is \nnormally selected on the application. A switch between tracks is possible pending approval from the \nDirector of Graduate Studies and as long as it is completed by the end of the first year of study at the \nlatest. Applicants may obtain additional information about the Department of Geosciences by \ncontacting the Director of Graduate Studies at the addresses above. \nProgram Overviews \nMaster of Science in Geosciences \u2013 Geography Concentration \nStudents seeking this degree and concentration are offered a broad range of courses that prepare \nstudents for research and professional careers that employ geographic methods, perspectives, and \nexpertise. A wide range of areas of specialization in geography include: urban geography, geospatial \nscience, physical geography, environmental studies, and human geography \nOur Geography students find internship and employment opportunities in a diverse range of sectors \nincluding local and regional planning agencies; federal, state, and municipal governments; non-\ngovernmental organizations and community-based advocacy groups; as well as private industry and \ncorporations. Applications and internship qualifications can be obtained from the department. Thirty-\nsix hours are required for completion of this degree. Further information is provided \nat geosciences.gsu.edu. \nMaster of Science in Geosciences \u2013 Geology Concentration \nThe M.S. degree program with a Geology concentration offers a broad range of courses that prepare \nstudents for research and professional careers. Research efforts in either thesis or capstone projects \nare in the following broad areas: geochemistry (analytical, aqueous, environmental, igneous, \nmetamorphic, and sedimentary), mineralogy, hydrogeology, petrology, sedimentology, structural \ngeology, and geoinformatics. Students that pursue the Geology concentration find employment in \nenvironmental consulting, mining and energy resource industries, state and federal agencies, non-\ngovernmental organizations, and related opportunities that utilize foundational skills and knowledge \nin geology. Thirty-six hours are required for completion of this degree. Further information is \nprovided at geosciences.gsu.edu. \nMaster of Science in Geosciences \u2013 Water Sciences Concentration \nA strong demand exists in public and private sectors for understanding of aquatic \nsystems, hydrological processes, and water resources. The M.S. degree program with a Water \nSciences concentration is designed to provide students with expertise in the quality, quantity, \nstorage, and flow of water in diverse environments; techniques to assess, model, and remediate \naquatic environmental problems; and paradigms for understanding the social contexts and \nimplications of water governance. Thesis research and capstone projects with faculty are carried out \nin the following broad areas: aqueous geochemistry, hydrogeology, watershed hydrology, water \nresources, ecohydrology, urban hydrology, water governance, meteorology, and applied climatology. \nThirty-six hours are required for completion of this degree. Further information is provided \nat geosciences.gsu.edu. \nDoctor of Philosophy in Chemistry \u2013 Geology Concentration \nThe Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in Chemistry with a concentration in Geology is offered in \ncollaboration with the Department of Chemistry. This program culminates in a dissertation containing \nthe results of distinctive and original research scholarship carried out by the candidate. The \ndissertation must be defended publicly and judged to be a significant contribution in the \nadvancement of science. PhD students are supported by external funding from competitive grants \nawarded to faculty in the Geosciences Department. This degree represents a collaborative \nagreement with the Chemistry Department at GSU, and is therefore primarily conceived as a \nprogram from students with a strong interest in chemistry-centric sub-disciplines of Geology (e.g. \nbiogeochemistry or inorganic geochemistry). \nProfessional Certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS) \nGeographic Information Science (GIS) is a rapidly growing discipline, with applications in many \nfields. A strong demand exists for proficient users of geospatial technology. The graduate-level \nProfessional Certificate Program in GIS is designed to facilitate those students working toward \ngraduate degrees in a variety of disciplines, as well as those who use GIS in the workplace and \nwould like to obtain systematic training in the field without having to complete a graduate degree. \nThe Certificate Program consists of five courses with a total of 18-19 credit hours, including elective \ncourses from a variety of departments/programs. Please contact the Department of Geosciences for \nmore information. \nDual B.A./M.S. and Dual B.S./M.S. Programs in Geosciences \nThe department offers a dual Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) or Bachelor of Sciences (B.S.) and Master of \nScience in Geosciences. The dual degree program is designed for high-achieving Georgia State \nundergraduate students majoring in Geosciences and allows students to complete both their \nbachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in just five years. Students are able to take up to four graduate-\nlevel courses as they complete their undergraduate degree, which would then apply to both the \nundergraduate and graduate degree programs. \nStudents must be formally accepted into the dual degree program by the department and College of \nArts and Sciences to be able to take graduate courses as an undergraduate. Additionally, \nacceptance into the dual program does not constitute admission to the master\u2019s program. Students \nmust fulfill regular graduate admissions requirements and apply for the master\u2019s program following \ncollege processes. \nInformation about the dual program, including application instructions and program requirements, \ncan be found at cas.gsu.edu/dual-degrees/. Interested students may contact the dual-degree \ndirector at the address above. \nFurther information concerning specific courses applicable to each program, concentration and its \ndisciplinary specializations is available in the departmental publication, Guide to Graduate Studies in \nGeosciences, which may be obtained from the department. \nAdmission Information \nDeadlines \nApplications for admission are accepted for all three semesters. The regular deadlines are April 1 \nadmission to the fall semester and November 1 for the spring and summer semesters. International \nstudents and students requesting graduate assistantships are encouraged to apply by the priority \ndeadlines of February 15 for fall admissions and October 1 for spring and summer admissions. The \nlate deadline for application for fall admissions is June 1. There is no late deadline for spring and \nsummer applications. Late applications may not be considered for graduate assistantships. Online \napplications must be submitted and all materials received to be reviewed for admission. \nGraduate assistantships are available for qualified M.S. and Ph.D. students. \nApplication Requirements \nIn addition to the general requirements of the College of Arts and Sciences, the Department of \nGeosciences has the following admission requirements: \n1. Three letters of recommendation on official letterheads from individuals who can evaluate the \napplicant\u2019s potential for graduate work. \n2. A statement (approximately 500 to 1500 words) of educational, research, and career goals, \nwhere the applicants indicate their desired area of specialization, faculty members they would be \ninterested in working with, and if they have made preliminary contact with that faculty member. \n3. Brief (not more than 250 words) rationale explaining preference for thesis or capstone track. \nIn addition to the above departmental requirements that apply to all applicants, concentration-\nspecific requirements are outlined below. \nAdditional Admission Requirements \u2013 Geology Concentration \n1. A bachelor\u2019s degree in geology, earth sciences, engineering or a related field. \n2. Foundational coursework: These courses are normally expected to have been completed as part \nof the applicant\u2019s undergraduate education and completed with a grade of C or higher. However, \nstudents who are otherwise qualified may be accepted under Special Status, with the condition \nthat this coursework is completed as part of their graduate study: \no \nMinimum one semesters of calculus \no \nMinimum one semester of physics \no \nMinimum one semesters of chemistry \no \nMinimum of two semesters of introductory geology or equivalent training \n3. For students seeking traditional disciplinary training in the field of Geology, who have aspirations \nof seeking Professional Geologist certification to work for a state or federal government, or for \ncertain career pathways in industry, supplemental foundational coursework should include that \nlisted below. Note that these courses are in addition to the foundational courses outlined above \nin Section 2, and are also expected to have been completed as part of the applicant\u2019s \nundergraduate education with a grade of C or higher. However, students who are otherwise \nqualified may be accepted under Special Status, with the condition that this coursework is \ncompleted as part of their graduate study. During the application process the prospective \nstudent can indicate their primary interests in their statement of goals and interests. The \ngraduate-admissions committee can then evaluate the students\u2019 undergraduate coursework in \nlight of their stated interests: \no \nMinimum of one additional semester of calculus and/or statistics (2 semesters total) \no \nMinimum of one additional semester of chemistry (2 semesters total) \no \nMinimum of four additional courses of upper-level geology or equivalent training \no \nMinimum of one semester of a field course in geology or equivalent training \nAdditional Admission Requirements \u2013 Water Sciences Concentration \n1. A bachelor\u2019s degree in geography, geology, engineering, physics, or related field. \n2. Foundational coursework for students who wish to specialize in physical-chemical aspects of \nwater science are listed below. These courses are normally expected to have been completed \nas part of the applicant\u2019s undergraduate education and completed with a grade of C or higher. \nHowever, students who are otherwise qualified may be accepted under Special Status, with the \ncondition that this coursework is completed as part of their graduate study: \no \nMinimum one semester of calculus \no \nMinimum one semester of physics \no \nMinimum one semester of chemistry \no \nTwo semesters of introductory physical geography or geology \n3. The Water Sciences Concentration is designed to support the educational and research goals of \nstudents with interests in social, political, and economic aspects of water resources as \nwell. Students with these primary interests would not be required to have completed the courses \nnoted above in section 2.a-d. During the application process the prospective student can \nindicate their primary interests in their statement of goals and interests. The graduate-\nadmissions committee can then evaluate the student\u2019s undergraduate coursework in light of their \nstated interests. \nDegree Requirements \nEarly in their coursework, all students must select a thesis advisor or project director to direct their \nprograms of study and help with course selections. Additionally, students should consult with faculty \nmembers to align their course of study with desired professional licensure and certification \nappropriate to their desired career trajectory \u2013 for example, either the American Institute of \nHydrology\u2019s Professional Hydrologist Certification, or the Association of State Boards of Geology\u2019s \nProfessional Geologist Licensure Examination. \nBelow is an overview of the degree requirements for specific program, concentration and track. \nMaster of Science in Geosciences \u2013 Geography Concentration \nThesis Track (Minimum of 36 hours) \nSatisfactory completion of: \n1.
