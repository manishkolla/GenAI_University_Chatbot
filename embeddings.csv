How to Use Your Pathways Map 
Step 1. Identify the map with the correct major.  
*   If you are thinking about changing your pathway/major, choose the map for your new pathway/major.  
** Please note that if you are deciding to eventually enroll in either the Associate of Science Nursing Program, Associate 
of Science in Dental Hygiene, or the Associate of Science in Radiologic Technology (DeKalb Medical or Grady Health 
System School) please utilize both the AS Health Science Professionals and your eventual career-degree program maps. 
Step 2. Cross out any courses you have already completed and earned credit.  
Start with the top box for foundations, then work through all the semester clusters.  Cross out each course you already 
have credit for.  
* For courses labels Area B, C, D, E, or F utilize the core curriculum worksheet on the back of the map to identify 
potential electives that you may have completed that would satisfy this area elective requirement.  
** Not sure if your class would complete a slot on your map? See our directions on using your academic evaluation. 
Utilizing your academic evaluation with your pathway map, gives your live look at your specific curriculum and should 
show how your completed courses are being utilized.  
Step 3. Find your essential courses. 
Starting with the top box, identify every course that has not been crossed out and list the courses in order. This list is 
your essential course list to completion.  
Step 4. Find your Balance.  
Using your essential course list, start building your schedule for next semester. Using the open boxes at the bottom of 
the map. 
*Keep in mind that in order to graduate or complete your program within 2 years. You must average 30 credits a year 
(Fall, Spring, and Summer).  
Tips on Credit Load 
 
Full time is at least 12 credit hours  
 
Minimum credit hour load for financial aid loans is 6 credit hours.  
 
To complete within 2 years  
o (Fall=15 credits, Spring = 15 credits, Summer = 0 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o (Fall=12 credits, Spring = 12 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o  (Fall=9 credits, Spring = 9 credits, Summer = 9 credits. Total for the year = 27 credit hours – 2 Year + 1 
Semester Path) 
o (Fall=6 credits, Spring = 6 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 18 credit hours – 3 Year + 1 
Semester Path) 
Step 5.  Get your plan approved.  
Bring your map AND your academic evaluation to your advisor and find out if your plan is optimized for success.  Your 
advisor will be able to help you build a strategy for completion and may have information on how best to balance and 
schedule your essential course list.

How to Use Your Pathways Map 
Step 1. Identify the map with the correct major.  
*   If you are thinking about changing your pathway/major, choose the map for your new pathway/major.  
** Please note that if you are deciding to eventually enroll in either the Associate of Science Nursing Program, Associate 
of Science in Dental Hygiene, or the Associate of Science in Radiologic Technology (DeKalb Medical or Grady Health 
System School) please utilize both the AS Health Science Professionals and your eventual career-degree program maps. 
Step 2. Cross out any courses you have already completed and earned credit.  
Start with the top box for foundations, then work through all the semester clusters.  Cross out each course you already 
have credit for.  
* For courses labels Area B, C, D, E, or F utilize the core curriculum worksheet on the back of the map to identify 
potential electives that you may have completed that would satisfy this area elective requirement.  
** Not sure if your class would complete a slot on your map? See our directions on using your academic evaluation. 
Utilizing your academic evaluation with your pathway map, gives your live look at your specific curriculum and should 
show how your completed courses are being utilized.  
Step 3. Find your essential courses. 
Starting with the top box, identify every course that has not been crossed out and list the courses in order. This list is 
your essential course list to completion.  
Step 4. Find your Balance.  
Using your essential course list, start building your schedule for next semester. Using the open boxes at the bottom of 
the map. 
*Keep in mind that in order to graduate or complete your program within 2 years. You must average 30 credits a year 
(Fall, Spring, and Summer).  
Tips on Credit Load 
 
Full time is at least 12 credit hours  
 
Minimum credit hour load for financial aid loans is 6 credit hours.  
 
To complete within 2 years  
o (Fall=15 credits, Spring = 15 credits, Summer = 0 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o (Fall=12 credits, Spring = 12 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o  (Fall=9 credits, Spring = 9 credits, Summer = 9 credits. Total for the year = 27 credit hours – 2 Year + 1 
Semester Path) 
o (Fall=6 credits, Spring = 6 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 18 credit hours – 3 Year + 1 
Semester Path) 
Step 5.  Get your plan approved.  
Bring your map AND your academic evaluation to your advisor and find out if your plan is optimized for success.  Your 
advisor will be able to help you build a strategy for completion and may have information on how best to balance and 
schedule your essential course list.

How to Use Your Pathways Map 
Step 1. Identify the map with the correct major.  
*   If you are thinking about changing your pathway/major, choose the map for your new pathway/major.  
** Please note that if you are deciding to eventually enroll in either the Associate of Science Nursing Program, Associate 
of Science in Dental Hygiene, or the Associate of Science in Radiologic Technology (DeKalb Medical or Grady Health 
System School) please utilize both the AS Health Science Professionals and your eventual career-degree program maps. 
Step 2. Cross out any courses you have already completed and earned credit.  
Start with the top box for foundations, then work through all the semester clusters.  Cross out each course you already 
have credit for.  
* For courses labels Area B, C, D, E, or F utilize the core curriculum worksheet on the back of the map to identify 
potential electives that you may have completed that would satisfy this area elective requirement.  
** Not sure if your class would complete a slot on your map? See our directions on using your academic evaluation. 
Utilizing your academic evaluation with your pathway map, gives your live look at your specific curriculum and should 
show how your completed courses are being utilized.  
Step 3. Find your essential courses. 
Starting with the top box, identify every course that has not been crossed out and list the courses in order. This list is 
your essential course list to completion.  
Step 4. Find your Balance.  
Using your essential course list, start building your schedule for next semester. Using the open boxes at the bottom of 
the map. 
*Keep in mind that in order to graduate or complete your program within 2 years. You must average 30 credits a year 
(Fall, Spring, and Summer).  
Tips on Credit Load 
 
Full time is at least 12 credit hours  
 
Minimum credit hour load for financial aid loans is 6 credit hours.  
 
To complete within 2 years  
o (Fall=15 credits, Spring = 15 credits, Summer = 0 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o (Fall=12 credits, Spring = 12 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path)

How to Use Your Pathways Map 
Step 1. Identify the map with the correct major.  
*   If you are thinking about changing your pathway/major, choose the map for your new pathway/major.  
** Please note that if you are deciding to eventually enroll in either the Associate of Science Nursing Program, Associate 
of Science in Dental Hygiene, or the Associate of Science in Radiologic Technology (DeKalb Medical or Grady Health 
System School) please utilize both the AS Health Science Professionals and your eventual career-degree program maps. 
Step 2. Cross out any courses you have already completed and earned credit.  
Start with the top box for foundations, then work through all the semester clusters.  Cross out each course you already 
have credit for.  
* For courses labels Area B, C, D, E, or F utilize the core curriculum worksheet on the back of the map to identify 
potential electives that you may have completed that would satisfy this area elective requirement.  
** Not sure if your class would complete a slot on your map? See our directions on using your academic evaluation. 
Utilizing your academic evaluation with your pathway map, gives your live look at your specific curriculum and should 
show how your completed courses are being utilized.  
Step 3. Find your essential courses. 
Starting with the top box, identify every course that has not been crossed out and list the courses in order. This list is 
your essential course list to completion.  
Step 4. Find your Balance.  
Using your essential course list, start building your schedule for next semester. Using the open boxes at the bottom of 
the map. 
*Keep in mind that in order to graduate or complete your program within 2 years. You must average 30 credits a year 
(Fall, Spring, and Summer).  
Tips on Credit Load 
 
Full time is at least 12 credit hours  
 
Minimum credit hour load for financial aid loans is 6 credit hours.  
 
To complete within 2 years  
o (Fall=15 credits, Spring = 15 credits, Summer = 0 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o (Fall=12 credits, Spring = 12 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o  (Fall=9 credits, Spring = 9 credits, Summer = 9 credits. Total for the year = 27 credit hours – 2 Year + 1 
Semester Path) 
o (Fall=6 credits, Spring = 6 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 18 credit hours – 3 Year + 1 
Semester Path) 
Step 5.  Get your plan approved.  
Bring your map AND your academic evaluation to your advisor and find out if your plan is optimized for success.  Your 
advisor will be able to help you build a strategy for completion and may have information on how best to balance and 
schedule your essential course list.

System School) please utilize both the AS Health Science Professionals and your eventual career-degree program maps. 
Step 2. Cross out any courses you have already completed and earned credit.  
Start with the top box for foundations, then work through all the semester clusters.  Cross out each course you already 
have credit for.  
* For courses labels Area B, C, D, E, or F utilize the core curriculum worksheet on the back of the map to identify 
potential electives that you may have completed that would satisfy this area elective requirement.  
** Not sure if your class would complete a slot on your map? See our directions on using your academic evaluation. 
Utilizing your academic evaluation with your pathway map, gives your live look at your specific curriculum and should 
show how your completed courses are being utilized.  
Step 3. Find your essential courses. 
Starting with the top box, identify every course that has not been crossed out and list the courses in order. This list is 
your essential course list to completion.  
Step 4. Find your Balance.  
Using your essential course list, start building your schedule for next semester. Using the open boxes at the bottom of 
the map. 
*Keep in mind that in order to graduate or complete your program within 2 years. You must average 30 credits a year 
(Fall, Spring, and Summer).  
Tips on Credit Load 
 
Full time is at least 12 credit hours  
 
Minimum credit hour load for financial aid loans is 6 credit hours.  
 
To complete within 2 years  
o (Fall=15 credits, Spring = 15 credits, Summer = 0 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o (Fall=12 credits, Spring = 12 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year 
Path) 
o  (Fall=9 credits, Spring = 9 credits, Summer = 9 credits. Total for the year = 27 credit hours – 2 Year + 1 
Semester Path) 
o (Fall=6 credits, Spring = 6 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 18 credit hours – 3 Year + 1 
Semester Path) 
Step 5.  Get your plan approved.  
Bring your map AND your academic evaluation to your advisor and find out if your plan is optimized for success.  Your 
advisor will be able to help you build a strategy for completion and may have information on how best to balance and 
schedule your essential course list.

How to Use Your Pathways Map 
Step 1. Identify the map with the correct major. 
* If you are thinking about changing your pathway/major, choose the map for your new pathway/major.
** Please note that if you are deciding to eventually enroll in either the Associate of Science Nursing Program, Associate 
of Science in Dental Hygiene, or the Associate of Science in Radiologic Technology (DeKalb Medical or Grady Health 
System School) please utilize both the AS Health Science Professionals and your eventual career-degree program maps. 
Step 2. Cross out any courses you have already completed and earned credit.  
Start with the top box for foundations, then work through all the semester clusters.  Cross out each course you already 
have credit for.  
* For courses labels Area B, C, D, E, or F utilize the core curriculum worksheet on the back of the map to identify
potential electives that you may have completed that would satisfy this area elective requirement. 
** Not sure if your class would complete a slot on your map? See our directions on using your academic evaluation. 
Utilizing your academic evaluation with your pathway map, gives your live look at your specific curriculum and should 
show how your completed courses are being utilized.  
Step 3. Find your essential courses. 
Starting with the top box, identify every course that has not been crossed out and list the courses in order. This list is 
your essential course list to completion.  
Step 4. Find your Balance.  
Using your essential course list, start building your schedule for next semester. Using the open boxes at the bottom of 
the map. 
*Keep in mind that in order to graduate or complete your program within 2 years. You must average 30 credits a year
(Fall, Spring, and Summer). 
Tips on Credit Load 

Full time is at least 12 credit hours

Minimum credit hour load for financial aid loans is 6 credit hours.

To complete within 2 years
o
(Fall=15 credits, Spring = 15 credits, Summer = 0 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year
Path)
o
(Fall=12 credits, Spring = 12 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 30 credit hours – 2 Year
Path)
o
(Fall=9 credits, Spring = 9 credits, Summer = 9 credits. Total for the year = 27 credit hours – 2 Year + 1
Semester Path)
o
(Fall=6 credits, Spring = 6 credits, Summer = 6 credits. Total for the year = 18 credit hours – 3 Year + 1
Semester Path)
Step 5.  Get your plan approved.  
Bring your map AND your academic evaluation to your advisor and find out if your plan is optimized for success.  Your 
advisor will be able to help you build a strategy for completion and may have information on how best to balance and 
schedule your essential course list.

Richard Milligan, Dual Degree Coordinator, rmilligan@gsu.edu 
The Department of Geosciences offers the Master of Science (M.S.) in Geosciences in two tracks: 
thesis or capstone option. The thesis track offers a research-intensive experience for students 
seeking additional advanced degrees or research-based employment. The track culminates in a 
thesis project. The thesis track affords the experience of writing for publication and is suited for 
students with a project requiring more time to pursue. The capstone track is experiential in nature 
and is the appropriate choice for non-academic professionals or students seeking a more structured, 
time-confined project. The track culminates in a capstone project that covers a variety of options 
such as case studies, internships, surveys, or extensive literature reviews. The M.S. track is 
normally selected on the application. A switch between tracks is possible pending approval from the 
Director of Graduate Studies and as long as it is completed by the end of the first year of study at the 
latest. Applicants may obtain additional information about the Department of Geosciences by 
contacting the Director of Graduate Studies at the addresses above.

Doctor of Philosophy in Chemistry – Geology Concentration 
The Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) degree in Chemistry with a concentration in Geology is offered in 
collaboration with the Department of Chemistry. This program culminates in a dissertation containing 
the results of distinctive and original research scholarship carried out by the candidate. The 
dissertation must be defended publicly and judged to be a significant contribution in the 
advancement of science. PhD students are supported by external funding from competitive grants 
awarded to faculty in the Geosciences Department.  This degree represents a collaborative 
agreement with the Chemistry Department at GSU, and is therefore primarily conceived as a 
program from students with a strong interest in chemistry-centric sub-disciplines of Geology (e.g. 
biogeochemistry or inorganic geochemistry). 
Professional Certificate in Geographic Information Science (GIS) 
Geographic Information Science (GIS) is a rapidly growing discipline, with applications in many 
fields. A strong demand exists for proficient users of geospatial technology. The graduate-level 
Professional Certificate Program in GIS is designed to facilitate those students working toward 
graduate degrees in a variety of disciplines, as well as those who use GIS in the workplace and 
would like to obtain systematic training in the field without having to complete a graduate degree. 
The Certificate Program consists of five courses with a total of 18-19 credit hours, including elective 
courses from a variety of departments/programs. Please contact the Department of Geosciences for 
more information. 
Dual B.A./M.S. and Dual B.S./M.S. Programs in Geosciences 
The department offers a dual Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) or Bachelor of Sciences (B.S.) and Master of 
Science in Geosciences. The dual degree program is designed for high-achieving Georgia State 
undergraduate students majoring in Geosciences and allows students to complete both their 
bachelor’s and master’s degrees in just five years. Students are able to take up to four graduate-
level courses as they complete their undergraduate degree, which would then apply to both the 
undergraduate and graduate degree programs. 
Students must be formally accepted into the dual degree program by the department and College of 
Arts and Sciences to be able to take graduate courses as an undergraduate. Additionally, 
acceptance into the dual program does not constitute admission to the master’s program. Students 
must fulfill regular graduate admissions requirements and apply for the master’s program following 
college processes. 
Information about the dual program, including application instructions and program requirements, 
can be found at cas.gsu.edu/dual-degrees/. Interested students may contact the dual-degree 
director at the address above. 
Further information concerning specific courses applicable to each program, concentration and its 
disciplinary specializations is available in the departmental publication, Guide to Graduate Studies in 
Geosciences, which may be obtained from the department. 
Admission Information 
Deadlines 
Applications for admission are accepted for all three semesters. The regular deadlines are April 1 
admission to the fall semester and November 1 for the spring and summer semesters. International 
students and students requesting graduate assistantships are encouraged to apply by the priority 
deadlines of February 15 for fall admissions and October 1 for spring and summer admissions. The 
late deadline for application for fall admissions is June 1. There is no late deadline for spring and 
summer applications. Late applications may not be considered for graduate assistantships. Online

International students International applicants are those students who are in the U.S. on a non-immigrant visa (B-1, H-1, J-1, etc.), students who are living outside the U.S. and who will require an F-1 visa to study in the United States, students who are in the process of applying for Permanent Residency status but have not yet received the Permanent Residency card or students who have been educated outside the U.S. Learn more about the application process. Transfer students If you’re already in college but need a change, transferring to Georgia State can provide you with the opportunities you need to succeed — in school and after graduation. View the details. Students begin the program by building a foundation in mathematics and computer programming and algorithmic techniques. They will then take 4 Data Science core courses: Fundamentals of Data Science , Machine Learning , Data Mining , and Database Systems . They will also complete the Ethics for Data Science as part of the core. Then, they will complete 15 credits of elective courses in Data Science and Statistical Learning. The program concludes with a required Data Science Capstone course in which the student will demonstrate overall knowledge of the discipline by completing a Data Science project, incorporating all the knowledge learned in the courses. VIEW CATALOG INFORMATION More information on Georgia State's undergraduate tuition can be found on the Student Financial Services website . The B.S. in Data Science is structured to best fit the needs of students who seek a foundation in data science to further their employment and education opportunities but who do not want to specialize in algorithmic (i.e., pure computer science) or business aspects of data science. We have consulted with industry practitioners to make sure that our learning objectives are current and valuable to employers.

Atlanta Campus Application Deadlines View Admissions Requirements VIEW ADMISSIONS DEADLINES College of Arts & Sciences Computer Science, B.S./M.S. Computer Science Program Director Dr. Xiaolin Hu xhu@gsu.edu The Georgia State Department of Computer Science offers a combined bachelor of science and master of science degree in computer science, allowing students to save a year of time and tuition as compared to pursuing the degrees separately. Students in the 4+1 program can enjoy several advantages, in addition to earning a bachelor’s and master’s in as little as five years: GRE is waived. Likely receive a tuition waiver for the year of graduate studies. Likely receive a stipend for the year of graduate studies. Use HOPE and/or Pell Grant funds for the 12 credit hours counting toward your B.S. and M.S. degrees. Increase your earning potential with the master’s level credential. Find out more details about the M.S. in Computer Science program . VIEW CATALOG INFORMATION Program Details Admissions Requirements Curriculum Tuition Goals & Outcomes Additional Information Description Incoming Students Incoming bachelor’s students will apply through Undergraduate Admissions. After acceptance to Georgia State, students interested in a dual-degree program should discuss the requirements for eligibility with the dual-degree program coordinator at the start of their sophomore year. If you’re a senior in high school or if you graduated from high school within the last two years, you’ll apply to begin your bachelor’s degree program using Georgia State’s Common Application. Find out more about applying . International Students International applicants are those students who are in the U.S. on a non-immigrant visa (B-1, H-1, J-1, etc.), students who are living outside the U.S. and who will require an F-1 visa to study in the United States, students who are in the process of applying for Permanent Residency status, but have not yet received the Permanent Residency card or students who have been educated outside the U.S. Learn more about the application process. Transfer Students If you’re already in college but need a change, transferring to Georgia State can provide you with the opportunities you need to succeed — in school and after graduation. Learn more about transferring to Georgia State . Dual-Degree Program Eligibility The Dual B.S./M.S. Program in Computer Science is available to undergraduate computer science majors who maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5. Students may apply at any time once they have taken between 30-80 credit hours. Email CASDualDegree@gsu.edu to discuss eligibility. If eligible, you'll be provided the dual-degree program electronic application to fill out. Decisions are typically emailed within 10 business days. Students accepted into dual undergraduate/graduate programs must work with the program graduate director each term to develop a plan for taking graduate courses during their senior year (or earlier for specific programs) degree program while still completing their final year of bachelor’s work. Acceptance into the dual-degree program does not constitute admission to the graduate degree program. Admission to the graduate program occurs in the senior year of undergraduate study and is contingent upon 1) successful completion of the bachelor’s degree, 2) maintenance of the required program grade-point average, 3) performance in the graduate-level courses taken during the bachelor’s degree and 4) meeting of the other admission requirements of the specific program. Additional requirements to qualify for the dual degree in computer science include: B or better grade in CSc 1301, CSc 1302, CSc 2720 and either CSc 2510 or Math 2420 A cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher and across the above courses Completion of no more than 4 credit hours in Area H Students begin by progressing through the standard B.S. in Computer Science requirements. In their fourth year, students enroll in graduate-level electives that will count towards both their B.S. and their M.S. in Computer Science. After earning their B.S. in Computer Science, students apply to the College of Arts and Sciences Graduate school. If accepted, students then go on to complete their M.S. in computer science. VIEW CATALOG INFORMATION For more information about dual degree programs, go to the Dual Degree Programs Overview . For general tuition information, check out our cost calculator or visit Student Financial Services for information on estimated costs. Going beyond the B.S. in computer science to also complete an M.S. provides students with advanced training in the fundamental principles, processes and applications of information, and computational technologies.

And researchers in other fields—environmental monitoring, for example—are increasingly turning to computer scientists to help them sift data and create models. DID YOU KNOW? Computer science is one of the most popular majors at Georgia State, with more than 2,100 undergraduates enrolled in the B.S. program. Undergraduate Study PREPARE FOR A FULFILLING CAREER IN A FAST-GROWING FIELD At Georgia State, computer science students learn to solve challenging problems and to master new technologies quickly. We also teach our students to work in teams to develop solutions. Pop culture might love the “lone programmer,” but we know employers are looking for people skills as well as technical skills and we prepare our students accordingly. We also encourage our undergraduate majors to connect to real-world opportunities. Our students intern at companies ranging from tiny start-ups to major corporations like Coca-Cola, Delta and UPS. UNDERGRADUATE FAQS B.S in Computer Science The bachelor of science degree program in computer science teaches students the fundamental principles and processes of computation and training in applying these principles in application areas in industry, science, government and business.

To be eligible for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and to enroll in major-level CSC courses (CSC 2720 Data Structures and all 3000- and 4000-level CSC courses), students must fulfill the following requirements: Complete the following courses with a grade of C or higher: CSC 1301 Principles of Computer Science I; EitherTheoretical Foundations of Computer Science or MATH 2420 Discrete Mathematics; and Either MATH 2211, MATH 2212, or MATH 2215. Students must earn an average of 2.5 grade points across the three courses areas (a, b, and c). The GPA will be calculated based on the first attempt at the courses designated above at Georgia State University. Where more than one course may be taken toward fulfilling the requirement (items a and b above), the first attempt at the first course taken from the list will be used to calculate the major eligibility grade-point average. For example, in item c, if a student takes MATH 1113 before taking MATH 2211, then the first attempt at MATH 1113 will be used for the major eligibility GPA. WFs counts as an attempt. Ws do not count as an attempt. Courses retaken using the university Repeat to Replace policy are not counted as first attempts. If a student has AP credit for any course designated above, the course will not be used in this GPA calculation, even if the student chooses to take the course. Transfer students who transfer these course(s) into Georgia State, may use the grades in the transferred course(s) to calculate the GPA or they may attempt them once at Georgia State. Courses taken at Georgia State’s Perimeter College count as first-attempts. Once students are eligible to take major-level Computer Science courses (CSC 2720 and 3000- and 4000-level CSC courses), they remain eligible to take them as long as they are eligible to enroll at Georgia State University, and they satisfy other Computer Science program requirements. Students must meet any prerequisites for the specific 3000- or 4000-level course. This requirement applies to students entering or re-entering the university in fall 2017 or thereafter, or to students who choose to follow the Computer Science program requirements in the undergraduate catalog for 2017-18 or thereafter. Students who have selected the Computer Science B.S. major but have not yet fulfilled the major eligibility requirement will be designated as Pre-Computer Science majors. Students in majors other than Computer Science including those minoring in Computer Science, may enroll in major-level CSC courses as long as they meet any pre-requisites for the specific course. Please see the computer science undergraduate catalog entry for additional information. What are the major eligibility requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Data Science? In addition to the general criteria for undergraduate admissions at Georgia State University, to be eligible for the Bachelor of Science in Data Science and to enroll in major-level DSCI courses [DSCI 2720 (Data Structures in Python) and all 3000- and 4000-level DSCI courses], students must fulfill the following requirements: Students must earn a 2.5 grade-point average across the three course areas (a, b, and c), with no grade lower than a C. The GPA will be calculated based on the first attempt at the courses listed below at Georgia State University. The designated pre-major courses are: a. DSCI 1301 (Principles of Programming for Data Science I); b. Either CSC 2510 (Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science) or MATH 2420 (Discrete Mathematics); and c. Either MATH 1113, MATH 2211, MATH 2212, or MATH 2215 Where more than one course may be taken toward fulfilling the requirement (items a and b above), the first attempt at the first course taken from the list will be used to calculate the major eligibility grade-point average. For example, in item c, if a student takes MATH 1113 before taking MATH 2211, then the first attempt at MATH 1113 will be used for the major eligibility GPA. WFs count as an attempt. Ws do not count as an attempt. Courses retaken using the university Repeat to Replace policy are not counted as first attempts. If a student has AP credit for any course designated above, the course will not be used in this GPA calculation, even if the student chooses to take the course. Transfer students who transfer these course(s) into Georgia State may use the grades in the transferred course(s) to calculate the GPA or they may attempt them once at Georgia State. Courses taken at Georgia State’s Perimeter College count as first attempts. Once students are eligible to take major-level Data Science courses (DSCI 2720 and 3000- and 4000-level DSCI courses), they remain eligible to take them as long as they are eligible to enroll at Georgia State University, and they satisfy other Data Science program requirements. Students must meet any prerequisites for the specific 3000- or 4000-level course. Please see the computer science undergraduate catalog entry for additional information. How can I find an internship? The department often sends job postings for internships to the CSC_UNDERGRAD mailing list . The University Career Services office on campus is also a great resource for landing an internship. Incoming Undergraduate Students What are the computer and software requirements for incoming students? Please see the document Computer/Software Requirements for Incoming Students . Prospective Undergraduate Students What kind of job can I get when I graduate? Typical jobs for computer science graduates include software developer, database administrator, information security analyst, mobile app developer, and data scientist. What is unique about studying computer science at GSU? GSU students have the flexibility in their degree program to earn a minor without needing to take extra hours. We also have three options for a dual-degree program in which students obtain both a B.S. and an M.S. degree in 4+1 years. What programming experience is expected before starting my undergraduate program? No prior programming experience is required to succeed in the program. What is the difference between Computer Science (CS) and Computer Information Systems (CIS)? Computer Science focuses on how and why computers work, explaining the technical and theoretical details, whereas Computer Information Systems focuses on how to apply technology in a business setting. A Computer Science major should have a strong background in mathematics and good problem-solving skills.

Our department has been at the forefront of this movement, having longstanding research collaborations with other science departments as well as other colleges, schools and institutes within the university. DID YOU KNOW? The department’s average annual funding from research grants exceeds $2 million. About Our Research Our faculty conducts research in a number of areas, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary projects that cross department boundaries. Our well-established bioinformatics research program has won many grants and produced Ph.D. graduates who now work at such leading life sciences companies as Guardant Health and Thermo Fisher Scientific and hold faculty positions at prominent universities, including the University of Southern California. A more recent area of emphasis is the application of data mining and data science techniques to fields ranging from astronomy to social media. Computer security is a rapidly growing research area, with department faculty participating in the Evidence-Based Cybersecurity Research Group and the INformation Security and Privacy: Interdisciplinary Research and Education Center. A measure of our faculty’s research success is the growing number who have won awards from the National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program. The CAREER grant, which emphasizes high-quality research and novel education initiatives, is the most competitive and prestigious award from NSF to young faculty members in science and engineering fields. Five faculty members have won CAREER awards: Dr. Xiaojun Cao (2006), Dr. Yingshu Li (2006), Dr. Xiaolin Hu (2009), Dr. Zhipeng Cai (2013) and Dr. Pavel Skums (2021). Research Areas Research performed in the Department of Computer Science can be grouped into seven broad categories. Data-Centric Education Human-Centric Interdisciplinary Security Systems Theory Data-Centric Data-Centric Computing Data-centric computing includes many research areas related to the processing of data. Our faculty’s primary strengths are in three interrelated areas: Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets, with the goal of extracting information and transforming it into usable form for future use. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses a variety of techniques to extract insights from structured and unstructured data. The data may come from a broad range of application domains. Machine learning involves the development of algorithms that learn to solve a problem based on sample data without being explicitly told how to solve the problem. Our faculty also performs research in causal learning, database systems, data integration, data processing and dissemination, population modeling and analysis, and spatial databases. Faculty Rafal Angryk Berkay Aydin Zhipeng Cai Xiaojun Cao Robert Harrison William Gregory Johnson Dustin Kempton Yingshu Li Wei (Lisa) Li Armin Mikler Robyn Miller Murray Patterson Sergey Plis Raj Sunderraman Yubao Wu Alex Zelikovsky Yanqing Zhang Education Computer Science Education Computer science education deals with the teaching and learning of computer science and computational thinking. Topics of particular interest to our faculty include collaborative learning in virtual environments and ways to broaden participation in computing. In Dr. Greg Johnson’s Ph.D. dissertation, he used data mining and machine learning to perform research on student success predictors. He is currently applying these techniques to discover the learning biases of first-generation and underrepresented groups in undergraduate computer science populations. Faculty Ashwin Ashok Anu Bourgeois Louis Henry Xiaolin Hu William Gregory Johnson Armin Mikler Human-Centric Human-Centric Computing Human-centric computing focuses on computer systems that mimic or augment the capabilities of humans. In our department, there are three key research areas: Artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines that can demonstrate intelligence, often by mimicking cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with extracting information from a digital image or video and arriving at an understanding of what is being seen, much as a human would. Digital image processing is use of a computer to process images through the application of algorithms. Common processing tasks include classification, feature extraction, and pattern recognition. Several of our faculty members belong to the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS) and have particular expertise in biomedical imaging processing. Other areas currently being investigated by our faculty include computer gaming, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, mobile health and natural language processing. Faculty Ashwin Ashok Robert Harrison Dustin Kempton Jingyu Liu Sergey Plis Michael Weeks Yanqing Zhang Ying Zhu Interdisciplinary Interdisciplinary Computing A key element of our department’s research program is its Interdisciplinary nature. We collaborate with many departments in the College of Arts & Sciences as well as other colleges across the university. Bioinformatics and computational biology has been the centerpiece of our Interdisciplinary research efforts for the last two decades. Our bioinformatics faculty members have won many significant grants and produced a large number of Ph.D. graduates. Faculty from our department have helped organize the International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA) since 2005. More recently, astroinformatics has emerged as a key area of research for our department. Dr. Rafal Angryk is a founding director of Georgia State’s Data Mining Lab (DMLab) , which specializes in the analysis of solar data. Several other CS faculty members also belong to this lab. Dr. Angryk was one of a group of experts who visited the White House in 2015 to discuss space weather events. Neuroinformatics is another recent area of emphasis. Four CS faculty members belong to the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS) , which develops tools for analyzing brain images and other data in order to promote brain health and diagnose disease. In addition, more than a dozen CS faculty members serve as associate faculty in the Neuroscience Institute , which explores the development, structure and function of the nervous system. Health and disaster informatics is the department’s newest Interdisciplinary research program. The Center for Disaster Informatics and Computational Epidemiology (DICE) develops computational methodologies to facilitate research in public health, disaster mitigation, and response planning. Several CS faculty members belong to DICE, which also draws its membership from geosciences and a variety of other disciplines. Additional interdisciplinary research areas in which our faculty are involved include computational chemistry, computational epidemiology, geoinformatics, and helioinformatics. Faculty Rafal Angryk Berkay Aydin Anu Bourgeois Robert Harrison Xiaolin Hu Dustin Kempton Jingyu Liu Armin Mikler Robyn Miller Murray Patterson Sergey Plis Raj Sunderraman Yubao Wu Alex Zelikovsky Yanqing Zhang Security Security and Privacy A number of computer science faculty members are engaged in research related to cybersecurity and data privacy. Cybersecurity includes protecting computer systems and data from damage, unauthorized use, and disruption of services. Data privacy involves allowing the controlled use of personal data while protecting an individual's privacy preferences and personally identifiable information. In addition to performing general research on cybersecurity and data privacy, our faculty have a particular interest in cryptography, intelligent threat detection and response, Internet of things (IoT) security, machine learning on decentralized private datasets and network security and privacy. Computer science faculty are deeply involved in two interdisciplinary Georgia State cybersecurity efforts. One is a center known as INSPIRE (INformation Security and Privacy: Interdisciplinary Research and Education) , which is led by CS professor Daniel Takabi. The other is the Evidence-Based Cybersecurity Research Group , a partnership involving the College of Arts & Sciences, the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, and the J. Mack Robinson College of Business. Faculty Ashwin Ashok Anu Bourgeois Zhipeng Cai Xiaojun Cao Robert Harrison Wei (Lisa) Li Sergey Plis Yubao Wu Yanqing Zhang Systems Hardware and Software Systems Within the area of hardware and software systems, our faculty has a particular interest in the Internet of things (IoT) , referring to physical objects that have sensors and software and are capable of connecting to other devices via the Internet. A related area that is also of great interest is cyber-physical systems , in which computer-based algorithms are used to monitor or control physical devices. Modeling and simulation is a long-standing research area in our department, anchored by Dr. Xiaolin Hu’s Systems Integrated Modeling and Simulation (SIMS) Lab . Known for its work on the use of drones in wildfire management, the SIMS Lab develops modeling and simulation solutions for problems in a variety of areas, including ecological science, social science and public health. Our department has considerable expertise in networking, including mobile networks and wireless networks. Other research in the area of hardware and software systems includes edge computing, mobile and robotic systems, signal processing and social networks.

An undergraduate may earn 3 hours of course credit for research by enrolling in CSc 4982 (Undergraduate Research in Computer Science); authorization is required before registering for this course. Student projects are eligible to be presented at the annual Georgia State Undergraduate Research Conference , an interdisciplinary event that highlights undergraduate research taking place across campus. The Undergraduate Research Conference is organized by Georgia State’s Honors College . Undergraduate major Djuan Blue recently completed a research project under the direction of associate professor Michael Weeks . Blue built a system that automates the process of homebrewing beer using an Arduino-based embedded system controlled by an Android application. Dr. Weeks got the idea for the project while brewing a batch of beer at home and suggested it to Blue, who had previously taken his embedded systems class. Before graduating from Georgia State, Blue presented his project at the Georgia State Undergraduate Research Conference. His work was later featured in an article in Georgia State University Magazine . Blue now works for General Motors as a software developer.

GET YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED 2024-25 FAFSA Application Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) 2024-25 FAFSA Application When was the 2024-2025 FAFSA Launched? Yes, The 2024-25 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) was soft-launched on December 31, 2023 . During the soft launch, the FAFSA form will be available for short periods of time while the U.S. Department of Education continues to monitor site performance and form functionality. They will continue to initiate pauses for site maintenance and to make technical updates as needed to provide you with a better experience. If your form is unavailable when you or your family members try to access it, please try again later. Will delays in the 24/25 FAFSA impact my eligibility for federal aid or HOPE/Zell Miller Scholarships? No. In short, don’t panic! You have time. We know that these new changes and ongoing updates can be frustrating to families. We are here to help. If you have any questions, please contact the Student Financial Management Center or check with the U.S. Department of Education for status updates at www.studentaid.gov . For HOPE/Zell Miller Scholarships, you may want to complete the state aid application in addition to the FAFSA. If so, visit the Georgia Student Finance Commission at www.GAfutures.org . I completed my 24-25 FAFSA and have heard nothing from my preferred school(s), why? The U.S. Department of Education will send FAFSA results to schools by March 31, 2024. Once Georgia State receives your FAFSA results, be on the lookout for any requests for additional documentation that may be needed. You will be contacted via email or text message to request this information. My school has received my FAFSA, and it is complete. They have not offered me any financial aid yet, when will I hear from them? Each school sets its own schedule for the release of financial aid offers. Georgia State will begin sending financial aid offers for the 2024-2025 year by May 1, 2024. However, some students' aid offers will be delayed because of the timing of when the Department of Education releases needed updates to schools. Be on the lookout for communications about your specific financial aid offer information. Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) What is a SAP appeal? Your GPA or Pace may be negatively affected by unexpected events that interfere with your ability to study and complete tasks successfully during the term.  These unexpected events may even result in you failing to achieve Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP). When this occurs, you may be placed in a SAP Warning, SAP Not Met, or Maximum Time Frame status.  If this happened to you, you may choose to appeal the process to ensure you continue to receive your Federal Financial Aid. Should you not have met SAP requirements and require further information, additional details are provided in this article. If you want to begin the appeal process, review the questions and answers below. LEARN MORE What is SAP Maximum Time Frame? The U.S. Department of Education has established a requirement that students receiving federal student aid complete their degree within 150 percent of the time frame. Time frame is evaluated by the number of hours attempted. Students who are unable to graduate within the 150 percent time frame lose eligibility for financial aid when the hours needed to graduate and the hours attempted exceed the 150 percent limit. For example, if your associate degree requires 60 semester hours to complete, you must be able to graduate with no more than 90 credit hours attempted. If you have attempted 45 semester hours and have 25 hours remaining, the total hours needed to graduate are 70. You are no longer eligible for financial aid without an approved appeal. If you are pursuing a bachelor's degree that requires 120 semester hours to complete, you must be able to graduate with no more than 180 credit hours attempted. If you have attempted 135 semester hours and have 50 hours remaining, the total hours needed to graduate are 185.  You are no longer eligible for financial aid without an approved appeal. In addition to the Appeal documents, you will also need an Academic Plan that outlines the courses required for graduation. You will need to strictly adhere to this plan to remain eligible for financial aid. LEARN MORE Why am I not meeting SAP, even when I have no failing grades? You may not be meeting the 67 percent completion rate required, or you may have exceeded the maximum hours allowed to complete a degree. Keep in mind that although withdrawing from a course will not affect your GPA, the ""W"" grade you receive means that course is counted as hours that were attempted but not successfully completed. LEARN MORE What is Verification? Verification is a process used to verify certain information on the student's FAFSA to ensure its accuracy. LEARN MORE How will I know if I have been selected for financial aid verification? Notification is sent to the student's PAWS e-mail account which will state that there are outstanding requirements. The student may review his/her requirements via the PAWS account. The student's PAWS account will list the document requirements and the status. You may also be mailed or e-mailed additional documents that are required. LEARN MORE Tuition For a complete breakdown of costs and fees, click the button below.

Most of the data are displayed in an aggregated format and is available to the public.  However, some reports are restricted to GSU faculty and staff. Users who need detailed, non-aggregated information may sign in to IPORT and view this information, provided they have appropriate data steward authorization. To view detail or restricted data, faculty and staff must log in with their campus IDs and passwords.  GSU students and visitors are not permitted to login.  When accessing worksheets, which contains detail data, there is an additional layer of security that requires approved user access to the subject area to view or to download worksheets. To obtain access to IPORT, you must first fill out a Data Access Request form To request adding information to IPORT, you must fill out a Service Request form Running Reports in IPORT How to run IPORT Report from Office of Inst. Effectiveness FAQs How Can I Get Data Access? Faculty and staff may log into IPORT to view detail data and/or restricted aggregated counts if they have the permission of the appropriate data steward.  Existing Banner users should contact the Office of Enterprise Data Management and Analytics at EDMA@GSU.EDU to gain access. Non-Banner users should download and complete the Data Access Request form and submit it to the appropriate data steward.  Users may download the Data Access Request form from our forms and documents page. How Often Does Data Refresh? Most data in the data warehouse are refreshed nightly until Census.  To review the data warehouse update schedule, click here . When is IPORT Available? IPORT is available 7 days a week from 7AM to 12 midnight.  The system is taken offline at midnight to begin the refresh process.

Cinefest Theatre Recent Video Four Pillars Pairing conversations with members of the Georgia State community with his own aspirations for Georgia State, President Blake believes there are four major pillars to build upon. These are the most impactful aspects of the university — present and future. RESEARCH AND INNOVATION For 25 years, Georgia State has ranked among the top research universities and has distinguished itself through tremendous expansion of its innovative research enterprise. We will ambitiously pursue continued research growth and impact. LEARN MORE STUDENT SUCCESS Georgia State is committed to student success and has eliminated achievement gaps based on race, ethnicity and income. We are a nationally recognized leader in this area, but we need to continue to push ourselves to go even further. LEARN MORE COLLEGE TO CAREERS Universities need to provide direct preparation for students focusing on “college to career” experiential learning while also accommodating career professionals who return to college to reskill. Adding new opportunities into the overall student experience can create better student outcomes and allow us to stand ready to strengthen the workforce. LEARN MORE IDENTITY AND PLACEMAKING We are one of the most diverse institutions in one of the fastest-moving cities. Our campus spaces must be the most inviting and rewarding for our students’ collective experience. On the Atlanta Campus, Georgia State can become a “college town downtown,” a sought-after destination for students. LEARN MORE Initiatives While major initiatives will begin after a reflective and formal strategic planning process, some ideas and short-term investments are too important to delay. Below, are the immediate initiatives. RISE CHALLENGE The RISE Challenge will provide resources for five interdisciplinary teams of faculty to develop transformative research at the university. LEARN MORE ASSESSING THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE Students on all campuses are being surveyed to gauge their engagement, use of space and facilities, and sense of belonging. LEARN MORE COMPENSATION STUDY The Human Resources deparment is working with an outside firm to conduct a salary study of all university employees. LEARN MORE Our New Strategic Plan As we begin a new strategic planning process at Georgia State, it’s a time to explore and discuss how the university can become an even stronger institution. As a result of our previous plan, Georgia State has made significant strides in many areas including supporting students and increasing graduation rates for all undergraduates, raising the level of research funding, and establishing new structures and programs that have launched academic excellence and culture. But we have not reached our full potential! Under the leadership of President M. Brian Blake, and with the talent and commitment of faculty and staff, we will draft a new plan using an inclusive and engaged process. As a premier urban research university, we have a crucial purpose within our state and beyond. With thoughts and voices from everyone in our university community, we will draft a strategic plan that provides a foundation for us to move Georgia State into the next decade of excellence. -Dr. Nancy Kropf, Senior Vice President for Strategic Initiatives VIEW THE LATEST UPDATES ""WITH THE TALENT AND COMMITMENT OF FACULTY AND STAFF, WE WILL DRAFT A NEW PLAN USING AN INCLUSIVE AND ENGAGED PROCESS.""

The observance in the United States was born in 1968 when Congress authorized the president to issue an annual proclamation designating National Hispanic Heritage Week.  It was expanded into a monthlong celebration two decades later. Learn more about the month and ways to celebrate the month on the Belonging@GSU page here . October is LGBTQ+ History Month! As part of the university’s signature heritage observance months, Georgia State’s Cultures, Communities & Inclusion team is marking LGBTQ+ History Month this October. Everyone is invited to join in on the celebration! LGBTQ+ History Month observes the history of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer/questioning communities and was first celebrated in the United States in 1994. Stay tuned and check out the Belonging@GSU page below to find ways to observe the month. Belonging@GSU Frequently Asked Questions How do I engage with CCI programming?
