Atlanta Campus Application Deadlines View Admissions Requirements Students may enter the program in the fall, spring or summer. VIEW ADMISSIONS DEADLINES College of Arts & Sciences Data Science, B.S. Computer Science The B.S. program in Data Science will provide students with a strong foundation in the mathematics and basic sciences, fundamental computer programming and algorithmic skills, strong foundations in data science fundamentals and methodologies, and a capstone experience to prepare students for a wide range of job opportunities. Students will also learn ethical standards related to the fast-growing field of data science. Graduates of the program will be prepared to enter the job market or to pursue graduate study in data science, computer science or computer engineering. VIEW CATALOG INFORMATION Program Details Admissions Requirements Curriculum Tuition Goals & Outcomes Description High School Seniors and Recent Graduates If you’re a senior in high school or if you graduated from high school within the last two years, you’ll apply to begin your bachelor’s degree program using Georgia State’s Common Application. Find out more about applying. International students International applicants are those students who are in the U.S. on a non-immigrant visa (B-1, H-1, J-1, etc.), students who are living outside the U.S. and who will require an F-1 visa to study in the United States, students who are in the process of applying for Permanent Residency status but have not yet received the Permanent Residency card or students who have been educated outside the U.S. Learn more about the application process. Transfer students If you’re already in college but need a change, transferring to Georgia State can provide you with the opportunities you need to succeed — in school and after graduation. View the details. Students begin the program by building a foundation in mathematics and computer programming and algorithmic techniques. They will then take 4 Data Science core courses: Fundamentals of Data Science , Machine Learning , Data Mining , and Database Systems . They will also complete the Ethics for Data Science as part of the core. Then, they will complete 15 credits of elective courses in Data Science and Statistical Learning. The program concludes with a required Data Science Capstone course in which the student will demonstrate overall knowledge of the discipline by completing a Data Science project, incorporating all the knowledge learned in the courses. VIEW CATALOG INFORMATION More information on Georgia State's undergraduate tuition can be found on the Student Financial Services website . The B.S. in Data Science is structured to best fit the needs of students who seek a foundation in data science to further their employment and education opportunities but who do not want to specialize in algorithmic (i.e., pure computer science) or business aspects of data science. We have consulted with industry practitioners to make sure that our learning objectives are current and valuable to employers. Description Careers The rigorous training provided by this degree program will enable the student to start a career as a data scientist in industry, government or community and non-profit organizations.

Atlanta Campus Application Deadlines View Admissions Requirements VIEW ADMISSIONS DEADLINES College of Arts & Sciences Computer Science, B.S./M.S. Computer Science Program Director Dr. Xiaolin Hu xhu@gsu.edu The Georgia State Department of Computer Science offers a combined bachelor of science and master of science degree in computer science, allowing students to save a year of time and tuition as compared to pursuing the degrees separately. Students in the 4+1 program can enjoy several advantages, in addition to earning a bachelor’s and master’s in as little as five years: GRE is waived. Likely receive a tuition waiver for the year of graduate studies. Likely receive a stipend for the year of graduate studies. Use HOPE and/or Pell Grant funds for the 12 credit hours counting toward your B.S. and M.S. degrees. Increase your earning potential with the master’s level credential. Find out more details about the M.S. in Computer Science program . VIEW CATALOG INFORMATION Program Details Admissions Requirements Curriculum Tuition Goals & Outcomes Additional Information Description Incoming Students Incoming bachelor’s students will apply through Undergraduate Admissions. After acceptance to Georgia State, students interested in a dual-degree program should discuss the requirements for eligibility with the dual-degree program coordinator at the start of their sophomore year. If you’re a senior in high school or if you graduated from high school within the last two years, you’ll apply to begin your bachelor’s degree program using Georgia State’s Common Application. Find out more about applying . International Students International applicants are those students who are in the U.S. on a non-immigrant visa (B-1, H-1, J-1, etc.), students who are living outside the U.S. and who will require an F-1 visa to study in the United States, students who are in the process of applying for Permanent Residency status, but have not yet received the Permanent Residency card or students who have been educated outside the U.S. Learn more about the application process. Transfer Students If you’re already in college but need a change, transferring to Georgia State can provide you with the opportunities you need to succeed — in school and after graduation. Learn more about transferring to Georgia State . Dual-Degree Program Eligibility The Dual B.S./M.S. Program in Computer Science is available to undergraduate computer science majors who maintain a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.5. Students may apply at any time once they have taken between 30-80 credit hours. Email CASDualDegree@gsu.edu to discuss eligibility. If eligible, you'll be provided the dual-degree program electronic application to fill out. Decisions are typically emailed within 10 business days. Students accepted into dual undergraduate/graduate programs must work with the program graduate director each term to develop a plan for taking graduate courses during their senior year (or earlier for specific programs) degree program while still completing their final year of bachelor’s work. Acceptance into the dual-degree program does not constitute admission to the graduate degree program. Admission to the graduate program occurs in the senior year of undergraduate study and is contingent upon 1) successful completion of the bachelor’s degree, 2) maintenance of the required program grade-point average, 3) performance in the graduate-level courses taken during the bachelor’s degree and 4) meeting of the other admission requirements of the specific program. Additional requirements to qualify for the dual degree in computer science include: B or better grade in CSc 1301, CSc 1302, CSc 2720 and either CSc 2510 or Math 2420 A cumulative GPA of 3.5 or higher and across the above courses Completion of no more than 4 credit hours in Area H Students begin by progressing through the standard B.S. in Computer Science requirements. In their fourth year, students enroll in graduate-level electives that will count towards both their B.S. and their M.S. in Computer Science. After earning their B.S. in Computer Science, students apply to the College of Arts and Sciences Graduate school. If accepted, students then go on to complete their M.S. in computer science. VIEW CATALOG INFORMATION For more information about dual degree programs, go to the Dual Degree Programs Overview . For general tuition information, check out our cost calculator or visit Student Financial Services for information on estimated costs. Going beyond the B.S. in computer science to also complete an M.S. provides students with advanced training in the fundamental principles, processes and applications of information, and computational technologies.

To be eligible for the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and to enroll in major-level CSC courses (CSC 2720 Data Structures and all 3000- and 4000-level CSC courses), students must fulfill the following requirements: Complete the following courses with a grade of C or higher: CSC 1301 Principles of Computer Science I; EitherTheoretical Foundations of Computer Science or MATH 2420 Discrete Mathematics; and Either MATH 2211, MATH 2212, or MATH 2215. Students must earn an average of 2.5 grade points across the three courses areas (a, b, and c). The GPA will be calculated based on the first attempt at the courses designated above at Georgia State University. Where more than one course may be taken toward fulfilling the requirement (items a and b above), the first attempt at the first course taken from the list will be used to calculate the major eligibility grade-point average. For example, in item c, if a student takes MATH 1113 before taking MATH 2211, then the first attempt at MATH 1113 will be used for the major eligibility GPA. WFs counts as an attempt. Ws do not count as an attempt. Courses retaken using the university Repeat to Replace policy are not counted as first attempts. If a student has AP credit for any course designated above, the course will not be used in this GPA calculation, even if the student chooses to take the course. Transfer students who transfer these course(s) into Georgia State, may use the grades in the transferred course(s) to calculate the GPA or they may attempt them once at Georgia State. Courses taken at Georgia State’s Perimeter College count as first-attempts. Once students are eligible to take major-level Computer Science courses (CSC 2720 and 3000- and 4000-level CSC courses), they remain eligible to take them as long as they are eligible to enroll at Georgia State University, and they satisfy other Computer Science program requirements. Students must meet any prerequisites for the specific 3000- or 4000-level course. This requirement applies to students entering or re-entering the university in fall 2017 or thereafter, or to students who choose to follow the Computer Science program requirements in the undergraduate catalog for 2017-18 or thereafter. Students who have selected the Computer Science B.S. major but have not yet fulfilled the major eligibility requirement will be designated as Pre-Computer Science majors. Students in majors other than Computer Science including those minoring in Computer Science, may enroll in major-level CSC courses as long as they meet any pre-requisites for the specific course. Please see the computer science undergraduate catalog entry for additional information. What are the major eligibility requirements for the Bachelor of Science in Data Science? In addition to the general criteria for undergraduate admissions at Georgia State University, to be eligible for the Bachelor of Science in Data Science and to enroll in major-level DSCI courses [DSCI 2720 (Data Structures in Python) and all 3000- and 4000-level DSCI courses], students must fulfill the following requirements: Students must earn a 2.5 grade-point average across the three course areas (a, b, and c), with no grade lower than a C. The GPA will be calculated based on the first attempt at the courses listed below at Georgia State University. The designated pre-major courses are: a. DSCI 1301 (Principles of Programming for Data Science I); b. Either CSC 2510 (Theoretical Foundations of Computer Science) or MATH 2420 (Discrete Mathematics); and c. Either MATH 1113, MATH 2211, MATH 2212, or MATH 2215 Where more than one course may be taken toward fulfilling the requirement (items a and b above), the first attempt at the first course taken from the list will be used to calculate the major eligibility grade-point average. For example, in item c, if a student takes MATH 1113 before taking MATH 2211, then the first attempt at MATH 1113 will be used for the major eligibility GPA. WFs count as an attempt. Ws do not count as an attempt. Courses retaken using the university Repeat to Replace policy are not counted as first attempts. If a student has AP credit for any course designated above, the course will not be used in this GPA calculation, even if the student chooses to take the course. Transfer students who transfer these course(s) into Georgia State may use the grades in the transferred course(s) to calculate the GPA or they may attempt them once at Georgia State. Courses taken at Georgia State’s Perimeter College count as first attempts. Once students are eligible to take major-level Data Science courses (DSCI 2720 and 3000- and 4000-level DSCI courses), they remain eligible to take them as long as they are eligible to enroll at Georgia State University, and they satisfy other Data Science program requirements. Students must meet any prerequisites for the specific 3000- or 4000-level course. Please see the computer science undergraduate catalog entry for additional information. How can I find an internship? The department often sends job postings for internships to the CSC_UNDERGRAD mailing list . The University Career Services office on campus is also a great resource for landing an internship. Incoming Undergraduate Students What are the computer and software requirements for incoming students? Please see the document Computer/Software Requirements for Incoming Students . Prospective Undergraduate Students What kind of job can I get when I graduate? Typical jobs for computer science graduates include software developer, database administrator, information security analyst, mobile app developer, and data scientist. What is unique about studying computer science at GSU? GSU students have the flexibility in their degree program to earn a minor without needing to take extra hours. We also have three options for a dual-degree program in which students obtain both a B.S. and an M.S. degree in 4+1 years. What programming experience is expected before starting my undergraduate program? No prior programming experience is required to succeed in the program. What is the difference between Computer Science (CS) and Computer Information Systems (CIS)? Computer Science focuses on how and why computers work, explaining the technical and theoretical details, whereas Computer Information Systems focuses on how to apply technology in a business setting. A Computer Science major should have a strong background in mathematics and good problem-solving skills.

Our department has been at the forefront of this movement, having longstanding research collaborations with other science departments as well as other colleges, schools and institutes within the university. DID YOU KNOW? The department’s average annual funding from research grants exceeds $2 million. About Our Research Our faculty conducts research in a number of areas, with an emphasis on interdisciplinary projects that cross department boundaries. Our well-established bioinformatics research program has won many grants and produced Ph.D. graduates who now work at such leading life sciences companies as Guardant Health and Thermo Fisher Scientific and hold faculty positions at prominent universities, including the University of Southern California. A more recent area of emphasis is the application of data mining and data science techniques to fields ranging from astronomy to social media. Computer security is a rapidly growing research area, with department faculty participating in the Evidence-Based Cybersecurity Research Group and the INformation Security and Privacy: Interdisciplinary Research and Education Center. A measure of our faculty’s research success is the growing number who have won awards from the National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program. The CAREER grant, which emphasizes high-quality research and novel education initiatives, is the most competitive and prestigious award from NSF to young faculty members in science and engineering fields. Five faculty members have won CAREER awards: Dr. Xiaojun Cao (2006), Dr. Yingshu Li (2006), Dr. Xiaolin Hu (2009), Dr. Zhipeng Cai (2013) and Dr. Pavel Skums (2021). Research Areas Research performed in the Department of Computer Science can be grouped into seven broad categories. Data-Centric Education Human-Centric Interdisciplinary Security Systems Theory Data-Centric Data-Centric Computing Data-centric computing includes many research areas related to the processing of data. Our faculty’s primary strengths are in three interrelated areas: Data mining is the process of discovering patterns in large data sets, with the goal of extracting information and transforming it into usable form for future use. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses a variety of techniques to extract insights from structured and unstructured data. The data may come from a broad range of application domains. Machine learning involves the development of algorithms that learn to solve a problem based on sample data without being explicitly told how to solve the problem. Our faculty also performs research in causal learning, database systems, data integration, data processing and dissemination, population modeling and analysis, and spatial databases. Faculty Rafal Angryk Berkay Aydin Zhipeng Cai Xiaojun Cao Robert Harrison William Gregory Johnson Dustin Kempton Yingshu Li Wei (Lisa) Li Armin Mikler Robyn Miller Murray Patterson Sergey Plis Raj Sunderraman Yubao Wu Alex Zelikovsky Yanqing Zhang Education Computer Science Education Computer science education deals with the teaching and learning of computer science and computational thinking. Topics of particular interest to our faculty include collaborative learning in virtual environments and ways to broaden participation in computing. In Dr. Greg Johnson’s Ph.D. dissertation, he used data mining and machine learning to perform research on student success predictors. He is currently applying these techniques to discover the learning biases of first-generation and underrepresented groups in undergraduate computer science populations. Faculty Ashwin Ashok Anu Bourgeois Louis Henry Xiaolin Hu William Gregory Johnson Armin Mikler Human-Centric Human-Centric Computing Human-centric computing focuses on computer systems that mimic or augment the capabilities of humans. In our department, there are three key research areas: Artificial intelligence involves the creation of machines that can demonstrate intelligence, often by mimicking cognitive functions such as learning and problem solving. Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that deals with extracting information from a digital image or video and arriving at an understanding of what is being seen, much as a human would. Digital image processing is use of a computer to process images through the application of algorithms. Common processing tasks include classification, feature extraction, and pattern recognition. Several of our faculty members belong to the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS) and have particular expertise in biomedical imaging processing. Other areas currently being investigated by our faculty include computer gaming, computer graphics, human-computer interaction, mobile health and natural language processing. Faculty Ashwin Ashok Robert Harrison Dustin Kempton Jingyu Liu Sergey Plis Michael Weeks Yanqing Zhang Ying Zhu Interdisciplinary Interdisciplinary Computing A key element of our department’s research program is its Interdisciplinary nature. We collaborate with many departments in the College of Arts & Sciences as well as other colleges across the university. Bioinformatics and computational biology has been the centerpiece of our Interdisciplinary research efforts for the last two decades. Our bioinformatics faculty members have won many significant grants and produced a large number of Ph.D. graduates. Faculty from our department have helped organize the International Symposium on Bioinformatics Research and Applications (ISBRA) since 2005. More recently, astroinformatics has emerged as a key area of research for our department. Dr. Rafal Angryk is a founding director of Georgia State’s Data Mining Lab (DMLab) , which specializes in the analysis of solar data. Several other CS faculty members also belong to this lab. Dr. Angryk was one of a group of experts who visited the White House in 2015 to discuss space weather events. Neuroinformatics is another recent area of emphasis. Four CS faculty members belong to the Center for Translational Research in Neuroimaging and Data Science (TReNDS) , which develops tools for analyzing brain images and other data in order to promote brain health and diagnose disease. In addition, more than a dozen CS faculty members serve as associate faculty in the Neuroscience Institute , which explores the development, structure and function of the nervous system. Health and disaster informatics is the department’s newest Interdisciplinary research program. The Center for Disaster Informatics and Computational Epidemiology (DICE) develops computational methodologies to facilitate research in public health, disaster mitigation, and response planning. Several CS faculty members belong to DICE, which also draws its membership from geosciences and a variety of other disciplines. Additional interdisciplinary research areas in which our faculty are involved include computational chemistry, computational epidemiology, geoinformatics, and helioinformatics. Faculty Rafal Angryk Berkay Aydin Anu Bourgeois Robert Harrison Xiaolin Hu Dustin Kempton Jingyu Liu Armin Mikler Robyn Miller Murray Patterson Sergey Plis Raj Sunderraman Yubao Wu Alex Zelikovsky Yanqing Zhang Security Security and Privacy A number of computer science faculty members are engaged in research related to cybersecurity and data privacy. Cybersecurity includes protecting computer systems and data from damage, unauthorized use, and disruption of services. Data privacy involves allowing the controlled use of personal data while protecting an individual's privacy preferences and personally identifiable information. In addition to performing general research on cybersecurity and data privacy, our faculty have a particular interest in cryptography, intelligent threat detection and response, Internet of things (IoT) security, machine learning on decentralized private datasets and network security and privacy. Computer science faculty are deeply involved in two interdisciplinary Georgia State cybersecurity efforts. One is a center known as INSPIRE (INformation Security and Privacy: Interdisciplinary Research and Education) , which is led by CS professor Daniel Takabi. The other is the Evidence-Based Cybersecurity Research Group , a partnership involving the College of Arts & Sciences, the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, and the J. Mack Robinson College of Business. Faculty Ashwin Ashok Anu Bourgeois Zhipeng Cai Xiaojun Cao Robert Harrison Wei (Lisa) Li Sergey Plis Yubao Wu Yanqing Zhang Systems Hardware and Software Systems Within the area of hardware and software systems, our faculty has a particular interest in the Internet of things (IoT) , referring to physical objects that have sensors and software and are capable of connecting to other devices via the Internet. A related area that is also of great interest is cyber-physical systems , in which computer-based algorithms are used to monitor or control physical devices. Modeling and simulation is a long-standing research area in our department, anchored by Dr. Xiaolin Hu’s Systems Integrated Modeling and Simulation (SIMS) Lab . Known for its work on the use of drones in wildfire management, the SIMS Lab develops modeling and simulation solutions for problems in a variety of areas, including ecological science, social science and public health. Our department has considerable expertise in networking, including mobile networks and wireless networks. Other research in the area of hardware and software systems includes edge computing, mobile and robotic systems, signal processing and social networks.

An undergraduate may earn 3 hours of course credit for research by enrolling in CSc 4982 (Undergraduate Research in Computer Science); authorization is required before registering for this course. Student projects are eligible to be presented at the annual Georgia State Undergraduate Research Conference , an interdisciplinary event that highlights undergraduate research taking place across campus. The Undergraduate Research Conference is organized by Georgia State’s Honors College . Undergraduate major Djuan Blue recently completed a research project under the direction of associate professor Michael Weeks . Blue built a system that automates the process of homebrewing beer using an Arduino-based embedded system controlled by an Android application. Dr. Weeks got the idea for the project while brewing a batch of beer at home and suggested it to Blue, who had previously taken his embedded systems class. Before graduating from Georgia State, Blue presented his project at the Georgia State Undergraduate Research Conference.
